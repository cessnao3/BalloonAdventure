# Balloon Adventure (Original)

My submission to the GMTK Game Jam 2021, with the theme "Joined Together."

My idea was to include a hot-air balloon with physics, where there would be the envelope and gondola joined together with ropes, and then weights initially to the gondola. Each of the tethers break if enough stress is placed on them, and the weights may be released at times to give the balloon some needed lift. This would force the player to determine when it would be necessary to release the weights as a strategy-aspect. The idea was also to include wind, which would force the balloon in certain directions. Releasing the weights also would remove the extra drag penalty from the wind, allowing for added control. However, performing the objective with more of the weights remaining would result in a better result for the player.

Unfortunately, I couldn't decide how to make an actual game out of these ideas in the time allotted, so the simple physics sandbox is all there is for the time being.
